We use web scraping to find relevant news for you.

Our technologies are similar to what Google uses for its search engine.

We take several starting URLs (journal's webpages), and our system finds the links to relevant news, this creates a link network which you can imagine it like a spiderweb. Once the system finds a news article, it extracts the information and saves it in our databases.

While the article is being saved, we execute a machine learning algorithm on it to calculate its positivism or negativism so you can select the news according to your state of humor.

Our Machine Learning team uses the following **open source** technologies:
* Scrapy https://scrapy.org/
* FastAPI https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/
* MySQL https://www.mysql.com/
* TensorFlow https://www.tensorflow.org/
* Keras https://keras.io/
